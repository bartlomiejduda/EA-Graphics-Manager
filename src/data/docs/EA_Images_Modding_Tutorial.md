Tutorial last update date: 09.07.2024<br>
Tutorial version: 1.0

## Info

This tutorial aims to teach you how to mod graphics in EA games
which use EA Shape files with file extensions like SSH, XSH, FSH etc.
You'll learn how to export images, edit them and import them back to EA Shape files.


## Prerequisites

You need to have downloaded latest version of EA Graphics Manager.
To check if you are up to date, please go to
**[program's release page](https://github.com/bartlomiejduda/EA-Graphics-Manager/releases)**
and search for "latest" version.


## Compatibility

Remember that currently not all image types are supported for modding.
EA file format supports over 100 image types and each image type
can be decoded and encoded in a different way.
To see if your game or image type is supported, please go to
**[readme's page](https://github.com/bartlomiejduda/EA-Graphics-Manager/blob/main/README.md)**
and scroll down to **"Image formats support table"** which can tell you what is supported.

## Getting EA Image Files

To mod games, first you need to get image files.
Sometimes files are directly stored in game's directory, most often in PC games.
But more often files are packed inside custom archives. In case of older EA games
all files are stored inside archives with **BIG** or **VIV** file extension.
There are some programs capable of opening and editing them like **BigGUI**,
**Final BIG Editor**, **big4f**. There are also a lot of quickBMS scripts written
by the community to deal with the archives.

Once you'll download a proper program or script, you can use it to extract data
from the archive and copy it to some temporary mod directory:
